; We define a network as follows:
; A network consists of two parts: a list of nodes and a list of connections
; The nodes list is structed as follows:
;  ;  A list of: ( (layer (nodeIDs)) (layer2 (nodeIDs)) ... )
; The connections list is structed as follows:
;  ;  A list of: ( (nodeID targetID weight) (nodeID2 targetID2 weight2) ... )
